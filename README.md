# ArtifactBay

> **The persistent home for AI agent artifacts — store, search, showcase.**

</div>

ArtifactBay is a **session-centric artifact repository** designed specifically for AI coding agents. It enables agents to push high-fidelity coding artifacts (such as HTML, markdown, SVG/PNG, PDFs, JSON, and chat logs) via a simple REST API, while giving human developers a polished, responsive dashboard to browse, search, and securely view these artifacts.

**Why it exists:** agents increasingly emit rich, interactive HTML — diffs, dashboards, call graphs, slide decks — that markdown flattens and chat windows discard. ArtifactBay gives that output a durable address: pushed once, versioned automatically, searchable forever, and rendered safely.

> 💡 **Inspiration:** this project grew out of [*The Effectiveness of HTML*](https://thariqs.github.io/html-effectiveness/) by Thariq Shihipar. Reading it changed how I use agentic programming giving me the input to start let the agents produce output as rich HTML instead of flattened text. The issue was that all those beautiful outputs were lost somewhere in agents temporary storage so ArtifactBay is where those artifacts live and can be consulted.

## ✨ Features

- **One-command push** — any agent drops files in `.artifactbay/artifacts/` and runs `artifactbay push`. Idempotent and fail-open (never blocks the agent).
- **Automatic versioning** — re-pushing the same session snapshots a new version; nothing is overwritten.
- **Full-text search** — find sessions by title, content, agent, model, or tags.
- **Safe rendering** — untrusted HTML runs in a sandboxed, cross-origin `<iframe>` under a strict CSP; scripts are off unless explicitly opted in.
- **Content-addressed storage** — blobs deduped by SHA-256 with reference-counted garbage collection.
- **Collections** — group sessions into saved searches or manual pins.
- **Agent integrations** — drop-in shims for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, and OpenCode.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Layout

ArtifactBay is organized as a decoupled monorepo:

```
artifactbay/
├── docs/                     # Specifications (v0 API contract, agent protocols)
├── backend/                  # Python + FastAPI + SQLModel backend service
│   ├── app/                  # Main application package (routers, auth, store, models)
│   └── smoke_test.py         # Integration & E2E smoke test suite
├── web/                      # React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 frontend
└── docker-compose.yml        # Docker compose environment for development/production
```

### Flow of Data
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent (e.g. Claude)
    participant API as FastAPI Backend
    participant DB as Database (Postgres / SQLite)
    participant UI as Vite + React SPA

    Agent->>API: POST /v0/sessions (with artifacts)
    note over API: Hash payload & verify Idempotency-Key
    API->>DB: Store unique Blobs & ref count
    API-->>Agent: Return Session ID & URL
    UI->>API: GET /v0/sessions (or collections)
    API-->>UI: Return metadata list & search documents
    UI->>API: GET /v0/artifacts/{id}/view (rendered inside iframe)
    API-->>UI: Serve HTML with strict sandbox & CSP headers
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- Or Python >= 3.14 (with `uv`) and Node.js for running natively

### 1. Running the Full Stack (Docker Compose)
To spin up the entire production-like environment (Postgres database, FastAPI backend, and Nginx reverse proxy serving the frontend):
```bash
# Build and launch all services in detached mode
docker compose -p artifactbay-full -f docker-compose.full.yml up --build -d

# The web dashboard is accessible at: http://localhost:8080
```
*Note: Use `-p artifactbay-full` so it doesn't collide with any local dev docker projects.*

To seed the active stack with demo data:
```bash
docker compose -p artifactbay-full -f docker-compose.full.yml run --rm backend python seed.py http://localhost:8080
```

To tear down:
```bash
docker compose -p artifactbay-full -f docker-compose.full.yml down -v
```

### 2. Local Native Development
For a fast inner-loop dev experience with hot-reloading:
1. **Start Postgres** in the background:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. **Launch Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload  # API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```
3. **Launch Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd web
   pnpm install
   pnpm run dev                          # Web dashboard at http://localhost:5173
   ```

## 🤖 Pushing Artifacts From Your Agent

The whole point: let an agent save its output in one step. The engine is a stdlib-only Python CLI (`integrations/artifactbay_cli.py`), wrapped as `artifactbay` on your `PATH`.

```bash
# 1. Point the CLI at your instance (keep the key in your env, never commit it)
export ARTIFACTBAY_URL=http://localhost:8080
export ARTIFACTBAY_KEY=ab_...

# 2. Drop anything worth keeping into the artifacts dir
mkdir -p .artifactbay/artifacts
cp report.html architecture.svg .artifactbay/artifacts/

# 3. Push — prints a shareable URL
artifactbay push --name "Database redesign"
```

- **Idempotent & fail-open:** safe to call on every run; if ArtifactBay is unreachable the push is queued to `.artifactbay/pending/` and the agent never crashes.
- **Versioned:** the session id is remembered in `.artifactbay/session_id`, so a re-push becomes **v2** automatically.
- **Preflight:** `artifactbay doctor` checks connectivity, auth, and staged artifacts.

Per-agent shims (auto-trigger or slash command) live in [`integrations/`](integrations/):

| Agent | Trigger |
|:---|:---|
| **Claude Code** | Skill `/artifactbay-push` (+ optional Stop hook for auto-push) |
| **Codex CLI** | `AGENTS.md` instruction → `artifactbay push` |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules` + VS Code task |
| **Aider** | `post-commit` hook (auto-push on commit) |
| **OpenCode** | `/artifactbay` command |

## 🧪 Running Integration Tests

E2E and smoke tests verify endpoints, session deletion, blob garbage collection, collection pagination, search indexes, and visibility constraints.

Run the test suite inside an isolated Docker container using an ephemeral SQLite database:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yml run --build --rm backend sh -c "ARTIFACTBAY_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./smoke.db python smoke_test.py"
```

## 🛡️ Key Architectural & Security Designs

### 1. Iframe Sandboxing & CSP
To prevent untrusted JavaScript executed inside agent-generated artifacts from hijacking sessions, stealing cookies, or reading local storage:
- High-fidelity visual artifacts are rendered inside a sandboxed `<iframe>` with strict browser directives.
- The `sandbox` attribute does *not* include `allow-same-origin`, forcing the iframe into a unique origin.
- The backend serves the view endpoint with a restrictive `Content-Security-Policy` header:
  ```http
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; img-src data: blob: https:; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; font-src data:; script-src 'none' (or 'unsafe-inline' if allow_scripts is true)
  ```

### 2. Content-Addressed Blob Storage & GC
- Artifact bodies are decoupled from structural rows and stored in a shared `Blob` table, keyed by their SHA-256 hash. 
- Repeated pushes of unchanged files do not consume extra space: the backend increments a `ref_count` for each duplicate write.
- When an authorized request calls `DELETE /v0/sessions/{id}`, a reference-counting Garbage Collector (GC) runs:
  - It decrements `ref_count` for every referenced blob.
  - If a blob's `ref_count` drops to `0` or less, the blob record is deleted.
  - Removes associated artifacts, idempotency records, and deletes pins in any active collection.
